# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

* bcrypt can be used to hash passwords, which makes it more difficult for attackers to crack them. This is important for security, as it helps to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.


* joi can be used to validate user input, such as passwords, email addresses, and phone numbers. This helps to prevent errors and protect your application from malicious attacks.


* joi-password-complexity can be used to enforce password complexity requirements. This can help to improve the security of your application by preventing users from creating weak passwords.


* jsonwebtoken (JWT) can be used to create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). JWTs are a secure way to transmit information between parties. This can be used for authentication, authorization, and other purposes.


* mongoose can be used to work with MongoDB databases. This makes it easy to store and retrieve data from MongoDB.
